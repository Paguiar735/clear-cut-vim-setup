    Ready-to-go Vim Configuration that doesn’t lock you in
  <br>
</p>

<br>

## Quickstart

Have you just gotten your hands on a foreign terminal and you don’t want to spend time making Vim easier to work with? Just run the following command and you’re good to go!

```
sh <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codespearhead/clear-cut-vim-setup/main/install.sh)
```

<br>

Alternatively, you can always run the installation steps from the installation file (install.sh) line by line.

## This Vim configuration includes:

1.  [**vim-airline**](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline): Status bar with custom color scheme
2.  [**vim-prettier**](https://github.com/prettier/vim-prettier): format your code on the go
3.  [**delimitMate**](https://github.com/Raimondi/delimitMate): insert mode auto-completion for quotes, parens, brackets, etc.
4.  [**coc-vim**](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim): code completion tool with language server extensions for JSON and YAML

## Project Goal

As you have gathered, the goal of this project is to bootstrap a minimalistic yet usable Vim configuration that won’t become ineffectual and bring you back to square one in case this project reaches the end of its life.

Clear-cut Vim Setup only installs a well-known plugin manager, vim-plug, and downloads your average Vim configuration file with pre-written settings you otherwise would have to write there yourself.

In short, there’s magic under the hood.
